Basic template that constructs a Single Page Application using `React, Typescript, Redux, Sass, and Mantine` to do fast development on.

## Usage

To use this template you can run it with:

`npx create-react-app [app-name] --template @hices/cra-template-spa`

This should create a file structure you may often see in anything I work on. Minus the testing utilities.

## Contribution

Occasionally I amy update this but go ahead and submit a issue or something if you want to use this and it breaks.
